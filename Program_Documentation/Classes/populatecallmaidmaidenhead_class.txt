 * The purpose of this class is to populate callmaid.maidenhead given callmaid.zipcode 
 * which was provided from FCC database via UIMain.jMenuItemPopCallmaidActionPerformed
 * Table zipcodegeo provides link from zipcode to lat/lon.
 * The original callmaid table contents were loaded from EN.dat by class ReadEntityFile.
 * 1) Get all maidenhead records with null maidenhead.  i.e. select * from callmaid where where maidenhead = ''
 * 2) If callmaid.maidenhead is not null then return to 1)
 * 3) Read callmaid.zipcode.
 * 4) Query zipcodegeo where zipcodegeo.zipcode = callmaid.zipcode. Get latitude and longitude
 * 5) If zipcodegeo not found then return to 1)
 * 6) Convert zipcodegeo.latitude/longitude to maidenhead using Maidenhead.latLonToMaiden()
 * 7) Update callmaid.maidenhead with result of latLonToMaiden()
 * Invoked from UIMain.jMenuItemPopCallmaidActionPerformed().
