 * The purpose of this class is to populate callmaid.cq and callmaid.itu given callmaid.state, callmaid.country, callmaid.zipcode.
 * It operates exclusively on country="US" records because it relies on state and zipcode.
 * Table zipcodegeo provides link from zipcode to lat/lon.
 * This is performed after PopulateCallmaidMaidenhead.java which populates the maidenhead.
 * 1) Get all callmaid records with (null ITU or null CQ) and country = "US".  
 * 2) If callmaid.cq or itu is not null then return to 1)
 * 3) Read callmaid.zipcode, state, country, callsign, maidenhead.
 * 4) Call USStateToCQITU(state,zippy,callsign,maidenhead) to obtain cq and itu.
      This method uses the state prefix to determine cq and itu.
      In the case of states within two CQ or ITU zones then CallmaidUtils.queryZipcodegeo(zipcode,callsign) is called to obtain the lat/lon.
      This method queries table zipcodegeo for the zipcode and returns a lat/lon if found.
      The longitude within the state determines the zone.
 * 5) Update callmaid.cq and callmaid.itu.
 * Invoked from UIMain.jMenuItemPopCallmaidActionPerformed().

CQ zones are numbered 1 to 32.  ITU zones are 1 to 89.
