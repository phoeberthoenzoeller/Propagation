Thread UDPProcessMessageThread is a state machine instantiated by UDPThreadManager.
The constructor passes the Vector object that is shared with UDPServerWorker.
Vector bufferVector holds ojects of MessageRecord.

The following elaborates on each state of the machine::
  case 0: Initialize.  Create PopulateAlltxt. 
         Method processMessageRecord is used in state=20.  
         goto state=10;

  case 10: Get MessageRecord from Vector bufferVector.
         If there are no MessageRecord objects in Vector then wait 10 seconds and return to state 10.
         else get the first MessageRecord from bufferVector and goto state 20.
      
  case 20:  Process MessageRecord.
         if messageType != 11(uncategorized message) and messageType != 10(null message)
         then call PopulateAlltxt.processMessageRecord.  This method accepts a MessageRecord, 
         processes it as described in PopulateAlltxt.  Included in that processing is creation
         of a CALLMAID record for the source callsign in the message if it does not already exist therein.
         PopulateAlltxt.writeToDatabase() writes MessageRecord to Alltxt table.
         If the qthrealtime flag is true and PopulateAlltxt.callcreateflag is true then goto state 25,
         else state 30.
      
  case 25:  Query HamQTH
         Call PopulateCallmaidHamQTH.hamqthToCallmaid(callsign). This queries the hamqth API,
         and updates callmaid with data from API response. More specifically:
         1) For the record in callmaid matching (callsign)
         2) creates a new CallmaidRecord,
         3) create a HamQTH.hamqthEntity object from a Get from HamQTH, parse the XML, assign to hamqthEntitry, return the hamqthEntity object.
         4) Update callmaid record with data from HamQTH.hamqthEntity object.
         If hamqthToCallmaid() fails to query the hamqth api then execute
         QRZCQ.QRZCQToCallmaid(callsign) which will query qrzcq.com for the callsign and populate callmaid with result.
         Goto state=30.
      
    case 30: Delete bufferVector record, goto state=10.
            
    case 90: Error restart, goto state=0.
     
    State 100 is termination state.
