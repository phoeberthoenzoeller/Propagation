This is a summary of the methods in class ReadWSJTXFile.java.


Constructor(String filename):
Open the specified filename.  If it doesn't exist then solicit file from user.
User Maidenhead.maidenheadToLatLon(Common.homeQTH) to assign this.latHome and this.lonHome.

List<String> readFileList():
Read entire ALL.TXT(or user specified file) into List.
Called exclusively by this.parseFile()

boolean parseFile(String callsign):
Called by UIMain
Read each line of ALL.TXT, parse into fields.
callsign is Common.callsign.  If not null then read of ALL.TXT is constrained to records of user callsign.
If called with callsign then read only those ALL.TXT records containing that callsign.
If called with null callsign then read all ALL.TXT records.
1) Calls this.readFileList() which returns List<String> which is converted to String[] lineArray.
2) For each lineArray:
3) Call this.parseFields(lineArray[x]) to parse data.  See below.  Assign result to AllTxtRecord atrec.
  if atrec is null then continue with next record in lineArray[].
4) Call maidFromCallsign(AllTxtRecord).

 


3) AllTxtRecord parseFields(String line):
a) Read each field from tokenized line of All.txt.  
  If value is not valid then return null.
  Use this.parseDateTime() for ldt.
b) Using the parsed fields create the AllTxtRecord object.
  Call AllTxtRecord.decodeMessage().  If return value is null then return incomplete record.


4) maidFromCallsign(AllTxtRecord)
a) First we populate, if necessary, callerMaiden.
   If callerMaiden was not assigned in AlltxtRecord.decode() then look it up in table callmaid from callerCallsign.
   If that fails then get a an approximate maidenhead from the callsign prefix.
   prefixMaiden is true if maidenhead was assigned from source callsign prefix.d
b) Next we populate, if necessary, respondentMaiden.
   If respondentMaiden was not assigned in AlltxtRecord.decode() then look it up in table callmaid from respondentCallsign.
   If that fails then get a an approximate maidenhead from the callsign prefix.



Counters:
  this.decodeSuccessesTotal.(recordsprocessed). AllTxtRecord.decodeMessage() returned true.
  this.totalRecords. lineArray.length.  Should equal lines in ALL.TXT text file.
  this.decodeFailuresTotal.  AllTxtRecord.decodeMessage() returned false.
  this.sourceMaidenheadTotal. atrec.sourceMaidenhead != null.
  this.databaseWrites. prodb.submitAlltxtDatabase(atrec) returned true.
  this.databaseWriteFailures.  prodb.submitAlltxtDatabase(atrec) returned false.
  this.prodb.duplicates.   Number of times that submit failed owing to duplicate primary key
  this.nonFT84Total.. Mode field is not "FT8" or "FT4".
