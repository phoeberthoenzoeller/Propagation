The JTS Topology Suite (JTS) is an open source Java software library that provides an 
object model for planar geometry together with a set of fundamental geometric functions. 
JTS conforms to the Simple Features Specification for SQL published by the Open GIS 
Consortium. JTS is designed to be used as a core component of vector-based geomatics 
software such as geographical information systems. It can also be used as a 
general-purpose library providing algorithms in computational geometry.
