GeOxygene aims at providing an open framework which implements OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) specifications and 
ISO standards for the development and deployment of geographic (GIS) applications. It is an open source contribution 
of the COGIT laboratory at the IGN (Institut Geographique National), the French National Mapping Agency. 
It provides users with an extensible object data model (geographic features, geometry, topology and metadata) 
which implements OGC specifications and ISO standards in the geographic information domain. 
Data are stored in a relational DBMS (RDBMS) to ensure a rapid and reliable access to the system but users do 
not have to worry about any SQL statements: they model their applications in UML and code in Java. 
Mapping between object and relational environments is performed with open source software. 
At present, OJB is supported and the mapping files for the storage of geographic information in Oracle or PostGIS are provided to users.
