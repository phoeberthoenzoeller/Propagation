OpenMap is a Java Beans-based toolkit for building applications and applets needing 
geographic information. Using OpenMap components, you can access data from legacy 
applications, in-place, in a distributed setting. At its core, OpenMap is a set of 
Swing components that understand geographic coordinates. These components help you 
show map data, and help you handle user input events to manipulate that data.
