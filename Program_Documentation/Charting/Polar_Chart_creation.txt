SwitchAdmin/Sensors classes:
c.PlotSensorResults:
  plotResults() Given a String[][] from sensor database query, 
    calls this.plotChart("Sensor record", sensorTypeString + " over Time", sensorName, this.xArrayTarget, this.yArrayTarget, "Time", sensorTypeString);
  plotChart() creates the JFreeChart and adds the series.  Creates Sensors.v.Charting.ChartTimeSeries and adds series.
    Sensors.c.Charting.ChartTimeSeries:
      This class utilizes the default TimeSeriesChart Chart class via ChartFactory.createTimeSeriesChart().
      The dataset is TimeSeriesCollection, implements XYDataset.
      The series is TimeSeries.

UIMain.jButtonComputeAdjustActionPerformed() // compare sensor to reference and compute adjustment. Creates PlotSensorResults.
  c.PlotSensorResults:
    plotChart(), addSeries.  // this plots adjusted values and compensation values as time series.
  Sensors.v.Charting.XYLinechart: addSeries(). // plots the adjustment functions.
  * XY line chart with XYSeriesCollection (implementation of interface XYDataset)
  * An XYSeriesCollection is populated with one or more XYSeries.
  * An XYSeries is populated with double, Number, or XYDataItem elements.
  * XYDataItems are comprised of double or Number elements.
  * Thus this graph is comprised of numeric x and y values.
  * If height or width passed to constructor are zero then height and width will be set to 95% of screen height and 99% of screen width.
  * Preset line renderer values are defined for a maximum of three Series.  Add to this.customizeChart to include further Series.
