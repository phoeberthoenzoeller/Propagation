Country abbreviations/names are two character abbreviations.
There is not wide agreement on what constitutes a country.
The Netherland Antilles disolved, but some of the the islands remained with Holland, some as countries, som not.
Many on the list are not independent countries but rather protectorates, possessions,
territory(american samoa), country within a kingdom(aruba), autonomous region(Aland islands),
oversees collectivity(Saint Barthelemy), dependency(Bouvet Island), 
external territoy(Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island),
external sovereignty(Faroe Islands), British Crown Dependency(Guernsey),
United States Minor Outlying Islands(Wake Island),
etc.

Remember that for every entry added to COUNTRYABBR then there must be an entry
in COUNTRYGEO with the lat/lon for that country abbreviation.
You must also map CALLSIGNPREFIXES.COUNTRYCODE to COUNTRYABBR.ABBR.

Apart from the liberties that others have taken with the definition of "country" I have 
added a few "places" that might be of interest to amateur radio operators.
Since no official country abbreviations, i.e. COUNTRYABBR.ABBR, include numeric characters
I use them for placenames abbreviations.  These have not yet been entered.

Prefixes to never use:
1B is used by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a de facto country recognized internationally only by Turkey, 
as such this has not been allocated by the ITU. Contact with 1B stations can lead to revocation of amateur operators' 
licenses outside the northern Cyprus.
