Read All.txt: Read the All.txt log file produced by WSJTX.  Parse it, write to ALLTXT table.
Write new callsigns to CALLMAID table.
UIMain. jMenuItemReadAlltxtActionPerformed(). New ReadWSJTXFile(Common.wsjtxFile).
Constructor creates supporting objects and opens the file.

UIMain calls parseFile(null).  Reads all ALL.TXT records via this.readFileList() into List.
String array is created from List.
Iterate through array calling this.parseFields() for each record.
parseFields() produces a MessageRecord which is then passed to this.processMessageRecord().
Finally the MessageRecord is written to ALLTXT table by this.writeToDatabase().


processMessageRecord().
If maidenhead is not included in the message then the maidenhead is derived from the callsign
in this.maidFromCallsign().
createUpdateCallmaid is called to create or update callmaid record.
If sourceMaidenhead is assigned then calculate bearing and distance to home QTH.


maidFromCallsign().
The goal here is to obtain the maidenheads of the caller callsign and respondent callsign when it is not obtained from the message.
Then assign sourceMaiden from either callerMaiden or respondentMaiden depending on value of sourceIs.
If callerCallsign is populated and callerMaiden is not; i.e.
if(atrl.sourceMaidenhead==null && atrl.sourceCallsign != null && !atrl.sourceCallsign.equals("") && !atrl.sourceCallsign.equals("..."))
then obtain sourceMaiden from CALLMAID via sourceCallsign.  
If CALLMAID does not provide sourceMaiden then get lat/lon from sourceCallsign and use this to obtain sourceMaiden.
sourceIsCaller is true when sourceCallsign is callerCallsign, false when sourceCallsign is respondentCallsign.
Return prefixMaiden which indicates whether the maidenhead was assigned from source callsign prefix.
First we populate, if necessary, callerMaiden.
If callerMaiden was not assigned in AlltxtRecord.decode() then look it up in table callmaid from callerCallsign.
If that fails then get a an approximate maidenhead from the callsign prefix.
prefixMaiden is true if maidenhead was assigned from source callsign prefix.d

createUpdateCallmaid().
If there is no callmaid record then create it.  
If there is a callmaid then update it if prefixMaiden=false.
prefixMaiden is true if maidenhead was assigned from callsign prefix.
The assumption is that the licensee provided maidenhead preponderates over that provided by the 
FCC database or approximation from country code.
