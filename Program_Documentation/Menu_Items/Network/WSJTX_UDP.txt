Overview: Initiate network interface to instance of WSJT-X.  
Log records will be received via this interface.
That instance of WSJT-X must have the "UDP Server" set to the receiving computer
that is running Propagation.

Workflow:
UIMain.jMenuItemWSJTXUDPActionPerformed() instantiates UDPWSJTX.
The constructor invokes this.serverInit() which creates a UDPSocket for server at specified address.
It then calls this.serverListen().
