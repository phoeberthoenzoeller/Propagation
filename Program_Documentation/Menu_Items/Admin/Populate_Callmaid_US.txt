Overview: Populate columns maidenhead, cq, and itu in table callmaid.
These fields are not provided by EN.DAT file from FCC.
Also, many records from EN.DAT have null or erroneous zipcodes.
There are about 15000 records in EN.DAT with null or erroneous zipcodes as of 12/01/22.
The query "select count(*) from callmaid where (zipcode = 0 or lastname = '' or firstname = '' or city = '') and country = 'US'" returned 41,723 rows.
lastname was '' in 29,679 rows, firstname in 29.683 rows state in 16,209, and city in 16,209.
In order to obtain zipcodes for these records we utilize an API at HamQTH.com.

UIMain.jMenuItemPopCallmaidActionPerformed() performs the following:
a) new PopulateCallmaidHamQTH().
b) new PopulateCallmaidMaidenhead();//populate callmaid.maidenhead given callmaid.zipcode.
c) new PopulateCallmaidCQITU(). // populate CQ and ITU for USA from state.

PopulateCallMaidenhead:
The purpose of this class is to populate callmaid.maidenhead given callmaid.zipcode which was provided from FCC database via UIMain.jMenuItemPopCallmaidActionPerformed.
Only null maidenhead records are populated.
Table zipcodegeo provides link from zipcode to lat/lon.
The original callmaid table contents were loaded from EN.dat by class ReadEntityFile.
1) Get all maidenhead records with null maidenhead.  i.e. select * from callmaid where where maidenhead = ''
2) If callmaid.maidenhead is not null then return to 1)
3) Read callmaid.zipcode.
4) Query zipcodegeo where zipcodegeo.zipcode = callmaid.zipcode. Get latitude and longitude
5) If zipcodegeo not found then return to 1)
6) Convert zipcodegeo.latitude/longitude to maidenhead using Maidenhead.latLonToMaiden()
7) Update callmaid.maidenhead with result of latLonToMaiden()
Invoked from UIMain.jMenuItemPopCallmaidActionPerformed().



PopulateCallmaidCQITU.popCallmaid():
1) Get all maidenhead records with null CQ or ITU.
2) For each such record call this.popcqitu().
3) Report results to user.

popcqitu():
1) Country abbreviation is obtained from current record.
2) this.getZip() is called to obtain zipcode from current record.
3) this.getCallsign() is called to obtain callsign from current record.
4) If country = 'US' then call this.USStateToCQITU() to obtain CQ and ITU.  Else return to caller.
5) Update the callmaid record for this callsign with the CQ and ITU values.

this.USStateToCQITU():
Based on state abbreviation assign CQ and ITU.
Some states are in two ITU zones, differentiated by longitude.
We get longitude from zipcode.
